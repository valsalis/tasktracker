TODO:
- when selecting a new task, but the time has NOT being stopped on the previous task, make sure the previous task keeps updating the clock.
- when importing a task.csv, make sure the ticks are loaded as well.
- add a save button so that it automatically saves to the last imported task.
- after export, if plot straight away error. Need to open in excel, save and then plot
- set the new time on click (from the dialog window) not when we close the dialog window


DONE:
- when double clicking on the second time it opens the setTimeWindow twice
- write 00:00:00 when pressing clear time
- set time with double-click
- start timer by pressing return/enter keys on the keyboard
